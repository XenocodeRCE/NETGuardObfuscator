## Step 1 - Create a new NETGuard project

By clicking on the '**New Project**' box you'll be prompted to fill in some informations to create the new project. You will need to enter **Your Application's Name**, and **A Little Description Of Your Application**. Then you are to select the compiled main project's file \(can be a .exe or a .dll file, only ONE file\).   
  
Once done the application box with automatically be filled with the new project you just created. Click on it to be sent to the Project **Obfuscation Settings** page.

## Step 2 - Project Obfuscation Settings

On this page you will be able to select **Obfuscation Settings** on the right, once clicked they will pop-up creating a list on the left on your screen. If you have a free plan you can select a minimum number of **Obfuscation Settings**, if you have any premium plans \(subscription or pay-per-use\) you can select everyone of them. When you are ready, click '**Obfuscate**'.

On this page you will also be able to update your project main file. We only allow files bellow 8MB size.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some premium plans have special unlocked features. See [NETGuard.IO store](https://netguard.io/store.php) page for more informations.

## **Step 3 - Missing Dependencies Page**

In the case where your project relies on different external dependencies \(.dll library files\) you will be sent to the **Missing Dependencies Page**. On this page, you are only asked to select those external dependencies files so NETGuard can process the obfuscation task. Due to the nature of the process we are to ask you to agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms Of Use.

After that you will be redirected to the **Obfuscation Output page** to download your protected file.

![Select your external dll files and accept our TOS/PP, and then click &apos;upload dependencies&apos;](.gitbook/assets/004.png)

## Step 4 - Obfuscation Output Page

On this page you will be able to download your obfuscated main file alone of with its original external dependencies, all packed in a .zip file \(Windows handle them by default\). This is convenient in the case you have multiple versions of these external library dependencies.

You have access to the selected features on the right, and the obfuscation engines log at the bottom.
