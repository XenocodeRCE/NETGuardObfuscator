# Obfuscation failed, refund ?

In this case we ask you to contact us by [mail](mailto:support@netguard.io) or live chat. 

{% hint style="info" %}
 Always include as much detail as possible in your request to fasten the work of the tech team.
{% endhint %}

After sending us the needed informations, there are 3 cases that might apply to you :

1. **You are premium member \(you have tokens\)** You need to re-try to protect the exact same file with different features. We do not charge you one token if the former file you tried to obfuscate is the same as the one you are currently trying to obfuscate. 
2. **You are not premium member \(you do not have tokens\)** You need to re-try to protect the exact same file with different features.  
3. **You were premium \(you had tokens\) but you used your last token on that failed obfuscated** You need to wait for us to reply before you can re-try to protect the exact same file with different features. Of course we will send you back the token.
